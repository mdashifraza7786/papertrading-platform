# Cryptocurrency Paper Trading Platform

This project is a Cryptocurrency Paper Trading Platform developed using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, with **MongoDB** for backend data management. It simulates real-world cryptocurrency trading without using real money, making it ideal for beginners and experienced traders who want to test strategies in a risk-free environment.

The platform provides a realistic and responsive interface to manage virtual portfolios, execute trades, analyze performance, and backtest strategies using both real-time and historical market data.

## Real-Life Problem

The cryptocurrency market is volatile, complex, and constantly evolving. Many beginner traders face the following issues:

- Losing real money due to lack of experience.
- Inability to test strategies without financial risk.
- Lack of understanding of how portfolios perform over time.
- No access to platforms that simulate real-world trading with actual market data.

Moreover, existing platforms often come with expensive subscriptions or steep learning curves.

---

## Solution

This platform addresses those problems by offering a free, safe, and realistic paper trading experience. It allows users to:

- Practice trading with real-time market data using virtual currency.
- Learn how to manage a crypto portfolio effectively.
- Test and analyze custom trading strategies.
- Gain confidence and skills before moving to real-money trading.

By replicating the behavior of a live exchange and integrating with real-time market APIs, the platform provides a hands-on learning and testing environment.
